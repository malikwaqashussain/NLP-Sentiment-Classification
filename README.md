# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Stock & Article Text using NLTK (VADER)

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** using **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**.
The focus is on analyzing the sentiment of **stock-related content** and **news articles**, applying preprocessing techniques and rule-based classification without training a machine learning model.
